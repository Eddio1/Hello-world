I am working on a simple murder myster game generate. The idea is to input a players. Generate information about player by asking them question. Potentially, being able to save player profiles. Picking a murderer and having it generate a list of clues, using the questions asked. The clues should be able to recudce the suspect to 1 or 2 people. 

THE HOW 
create the class/obj ,idk verbiage, i.e player. Give the player true false atributes. select a killer. run player info through if else statement to genercate a hint path to murder. (muddy on th details here)
